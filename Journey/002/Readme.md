# Day 2/100

## Cloud Research

Wow, the first steps are HARD.

I’ve spent countless hours surveying the landscape, and if I’ve learned anything since Day 1… I hardly know anything at all! There is so so much to learn, and my “to do next” list is getting much longer than I anticipated.

My focus for this post is getting myself set up to learn, play and experiment in the bits of cloud that interest me, whilst delving deeper into the areas that should interest me.
